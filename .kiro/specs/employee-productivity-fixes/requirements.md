# Employee Productivity Report Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical issues in the Employee Productivity report within the Reports & Analytics system. The current implementation has calculation errors, incorrect item counting logic, and includes labor cost features that need to be removed. The report should accurately track employee productivity based on station completion and production time spent.

## Glossary

- **Employee_Productivity_System**: The system that tracks and reports on employee performance metrics
- **Production_Item**: An order item marked with isProduct = true that goes through production stages
- **Station_Completion**: When an employee scans an item to move it from their current station to the next station in the workflow
- **Items_Processed**: Count of unique production items that an employee has completed at their assigned station
- **Production_Time**: Total time spent by an employee processing items at their station

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Correct Items Processed Calculation

**User Story:** As a production manager, I want to see the accurate count of items each employee has processed at their station so that I can measure their productivity correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee completes work at their station THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL count that item as processed by that employee
2. WHEN calculating items processed THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL only count unique Production_Items per employee per station
3. WHEN an employee scans an item to move it to the next station THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL record this as a Station_Completion
4. WHEN multiple scans occur for the same item at the same station THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL count it as only 1 item processed
5. WHEN an item is not a Production_Item THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL exclude it from productivity calculations

### Requirement 2: Accurate Production Time Tracking

**User Story:** As a production supervisor, I want to see the actual time employees spend processing items so that I can identify efficiency opportunities and bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating production time THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL sum all durationInSeconds from ItemProcessingLog records
2. WHEN an employee works at multiple stations THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL track time separately for each station
3. WHEN displaying production time THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show time in hours and minutes format
4. WHEN processing logs have invalid or missing duration THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL exclude those records from time calculations
5. WHEN calculating average time per item THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL divide total production time by items processed

### Requirement 3: Remove Labor Cost Features

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all labor cost calculations and displays removed from the productivity report so that the system focuses only on time and item metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying productivity data THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL NOT show any labor cost columns or calculations
2. WHEN calculating summary statistics THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL NOT include total labor cost metrics

1. WHEN filtering by station THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show only employees who worked at that station
2. WHEN no station filter is applied THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show all employees with their station breakdown
3. WHEN an employee works at multiple stations THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show separate rows for each station
4. WHEN displaying station data THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL include station name and employee assignment information
5. WHEN filtering by station THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL maintain accurate item counts and time calculations

### Requirement 5: Employee-Based Filtering and Reporting

**User Story:** As a production supervisor, I want to filter productivity reports by specific employees so that I can review individual performance and provide targeted feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filtering by employee THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show only that employee's productivity data
2. WHEN no employee filter is applied THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show all active employees with production activity
3. WHEN displaying employee data THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL include employee name and station assignments
4. WHEN an employee has no activity THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL exclude them from the report
5. WHEN filtering by employee THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show their performance across all stations they worked at

### Requirement 6: Date Range Filtering

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to filter productivity reports by date range so that I can analyze performance trends over specific time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a date range THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL filter ItemProcessingLog records by startTime and endTime
2. WHEN no date range is specified THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL default to the last 30 days
3. WHEN date range is invalid THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show appropriate error messages
4. WHEN date range is too large THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL warn about performance implications
5. WHEN displaying filtered data THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show the applied date range in the report

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Summary Statistics

**User Story:** As a production manager, I want to see accurate summary statistics for the productivity report so that I can quickly understand overall performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating summary statistics THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show total active employees in the report
2. WHEN calculating total items processed THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL sum unique items across all employees and stations
3. WHEN calculating total production time THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL sum all processing time across all employees
4. WHEN displaying summary statistics THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL NOT include any labor cost metrics
5. WHEN no data is available THEN the Employee_Productivity_System SHALL show zero values with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 8: Employee Item Details Modal
