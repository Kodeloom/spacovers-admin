# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing order creation system to support direct item attribute creation, adds tie-down length tracking, implements Purchase Order (PO) number management at both order and order item levels, includes PO number validation to prevent duplicates within the same customer, and adds a "No Priority" option to the order priority system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an office employee, I want to create order items with their product attributes directly during order creation, so that I can streamline the order entry process and avoid separate attribute configuration steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new order item THEN the system SHALL provide fields to input product attributes directly
2. WHEN product attributes are entered during order item creation THEN the system SHALL validate the attributes according to existing business rules
3. WHEN an order item is created with attributes THEN the system SHALL automatically create the corresponding ProductAttribute record
4. WHEN product attributes are provided during creation THEN the system SHALL mark the attributes as verified by default
5. IF product attributes are invalid THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent order item creation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager, I want to track tie-down length for order items, so that I can ensure proper production specifications and quality control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing an order item THEN the system SHALL provide a tie-down length field
2. WHEN tie-down length is specified THEN the system SHALL store the value as part of the order item attributes
3. WHEN displaying order item details THEN the system SHALL show the tie-down length information
4. WHEN tie-down length is not specified THEN the system SHALL allow the field to remain empty

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an office employee, I want to assign Purchase Order (PO) numbers at the order level, so that I can track customer purchase orders for the entire order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new order THEN the system SHALL provide an optional PO number field
2. WHEN a PO number is entered at the order level THEN the system SHALL store it with the order
3. WHEN displaying order details THEN the system SHALL show the order-level PO number
4. WHEN editing an order THEN the system SHALL allow modification of the order-level PO number

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an office employee, I want to assign Purchase Order (PO) numbers at the order item level, so that I can track different PO numbers for individual items within the same order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new order item THEN the system SHALL provide an optional PO number field
2. WHEN a PO number is entered at the order item level THEN the system SHALL store it with the order item
3. WHEN displaying order item details THEN the system SHALL show the item-level PO number
4. WHEN editing an order item THEN the system SHALL allow modification of the item-level PO number

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an office employee, I want the system to prevent duplicate PO numbers within the same customer, so that I can avoid confusion and maintain data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an order with a PO number THEN the system SHALL check if the PO number already exists for any order or order item within the same customer
2. WHEN creating an order item with a PO number THEN the system SHALL check if the PO number already exists for any order or order item within the same customer
3. IF a duplicate PO number is detected THEN the system SHALL display a warning message indicating the existing usage
4. IF a duplicate PO number is detected THEN the system SHALL prevent the order or order item creation until the PO number is changed or the user explicitly confirms the duplicate
5. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN the system SHALL only consider active orders and order items (not archived or cancelled)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an office employee, I want to set order priority to "No Priority", so that I can handle orders that don't require specific prioritization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new order THEN the system SHALL include "No Priority" as an option in the priority dropdown
2. WHEN "No Priority" is selected THEN the system SHALL store this as a valid priority level
3. WHEN displaying orders THEN the system SHALL show "No Priority" orders appropriately in lists and filters
4. WHEN sorting orders by priority THEN the system SHALL handle "No Priority" orders consistently (typically at the bottom of priority-sorted lists)
5. WHEN filtering orders by priority THEN the system SHALL include "No Priority" as a filterable option

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the enhanced order creation to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing orders and workflows continue to function without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is updated THEN existing orders SHALL continue to display and function correctly
2. WHEN existing orders are edited THEN the new fields SHALL be available but not required
3. WHEN migrating the system THEN existing order items without tie-down length SHALL display appropriately
4. WHEN accessing legacy orders THEN the system SHALL handle missing PO numbers gracefully
5. WHEN the priority system is updated THEN existing orders with current priority levels SHALL remain unchanged
