# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a new split-label printing system with a print queue for order items. The system will replace the current single-label format with a two-part label system (3x3 top part and 2x3 bottom part) that can be separated during production. The system includes a print queue that batches labels for efficient printing on 4-label sheets, ensuring both parts of each label contain essential information for production workflow continuity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Split Label Format Design

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want each order item to have two separate label parts so that one part can stay with the cover while the other moves through production stations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a label is generated THEN it SHALL consist of two parts: a 3x3 inch top section and a 2x3 inch bottom section
2. WHEN both label parts are created THEN each part SHALL contain customer name, thickness, size, type, color, date, and barcode
3. WHEN label information is displayed THEN it SHALL be efficiently formatted to fit the smaller label dimensions
4. WHEN labels are designed THEN they SHALL maintain readability and scannability despite the compact format
5. WHEN upgrades exist for an item THEN they SHALL be displayed efficiently within the space constraints

### Requirement 2: Print Queue Management System

**User Story:** As an office employee, admin, or super admin, I want to queue labels for batch printing so that I can efficiently use 4-label sheets and reduce paper waste.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates a label THEN it SHALL be added to a print queue instead of printing immediately
2. WHEN the print queue is accessed THEN it SHALL display all queued labels with preview capability
3. WHEN there are 4 labels in the queue THEN the system SHALL allow printing without warnings
4. WHEN there are fewer than 4 labels in the queue THEN the system SHALL display warnings before allowing printing
5. WHEN labels are printed THEN they SHALL be removed from the print queue
6. WHEN users want to clear the queue THEN they SHALL be able to remove individual labels or clear all
7. WHEN labels are arranged for printing THEN they SHALL fit within an 8.5" x 11" page with 0.50" top/bottom margins and 1.25" left/right margins
8. WHEN the 4 labels are positioned THEN they SHALL be arranged in a 2x2 grid within the printable area

### Requirement 3: Efficient Information Display

**User Story:** As a production worker, I want all essential information clearly visible on both label parts so that I can process items correctly regardless of which part I have.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN essential information is displayed THEN it SHALL include customer, thickness, size, type, color, date, and barcode on both parts
2. WHEN upgrades are present THEN they SHALL be shown in a condensed, readable format
3. WHEN text is rendered THEN it SHALL be appropriately sized for the label dimensions
4. WHEN barcodes are generated THEN they SHALL remain scannable at the smaller size
5. WHEN information is too long THEN it SHALL be abbreviated or truncated intelligently

### Requirement 4: Print Queue Interface

**User Story:** As an office employee, admin, or super admin, I want an intuitive interface to manage the print queue so that I can efficiently batch and print labels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the print queue THEN users SHALL see a dedicated page showing all queued labels
2. WHEN viewing queued labels THEN each entry SHALL show a preview of both label parts
3. WHEN managing the queue THEN users SHALL be able to reorder, remove, or add labels
4. WHEN printing is initiated THEN the system SHALL show clear warnings if fewer than 4 labels are queued
5. WHEN the queue is full (4 labels) THEN the print button SHALL be prominently available without warnings

### Requirement 5: Label Generation Integration

**User Story:** As a warehouse administrator, I want the new label system to integrate seamlessly with existing order item workflows so that current processes are minimally disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN order items are processed THEN the label generation SHALL use the new split format
2. WHEN existing barcode systems are used THEN they SHALL work with the new label format
3. WHEN labels are generated THEN all current order item information SHALL be preserved and displayed
4. WHEN the system generates labels THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with existing printer hardware
5. WHEN users access label functions THEN they SHALL find them in familiar locations within the interface

### Requirement 6: Print Warning System

**User Story:** As an office employee, admin, or super admin, I want clear warnings when printing incomplete batches so that I can make informed decisions about paper usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting to print with 1-3 labels THEN the system SHALL display a warning about incomplete batch
2. WHEN the first warning is acknowledged THEN a second confirmation warning SHALL appear
3. WHEN both warnings are confirmed THEN printing SHALL proceed with the partial batch
4. WHEN warnings are displayed THEN they SHALL clearly explain the paper waste implications
5. WHEN users cancel at any warning THEN they SHALL return to the print queue without printing
