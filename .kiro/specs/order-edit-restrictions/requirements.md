# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements read-only restrictions for verified product attributes when orders have been approved. The system will prevent editing of verified product attributes once an order reaches approved status, ensuring data integrity and preventing accidental changes to production-ready specifications.

## Glossary

- **Order_System**: The administrative order management system
- **Product_Attributes**: Specifications for products including dimensions, colors, materials, and other manufacturing details
- **Verification_Status**: Boolean flag indicating whether product attributes have been verified by authorized personnel
- **Order_Status**: Current state of an order in the workflow (PENDING, APPROVED, ORDER_PROCESSING, etc.)
- **Read_Only_Mode**: Display mode where product attributes are visible but cannot be modified
- **Edit_Mode**: Interactive mode where product attributes can be modified and saved
- **Super_Admin**: User with elevated privileges who can override read-only restrictions
- **Packing_Slip**: Document generated for order items that indicates production readiness

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want verified product attributes to become read-only when an order is approved, so that production specifications cannot be accidentally modified after verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order item has verified product attributes AND the order status is APPROVED or beyond, THE Order_System SHALL display product attributes in Read_Only_Mode
2. WHILE an order item has verified product attributes AND the order is in Read_Only_Mode, THE Order_System SHALL prevent any modifications to the product attributes
3. IF a user attempts to edit verified product attributes on an approved order, THEN THE Order_System SHALL display a clear indication that attributes are locked
4. WHERE an order item has unverified product attributes OR the order is not approved, THE Order_System SHALL allow editing of product attributes
5. THE Order_System SHALL display verification status and order approval status to users when showing product attributes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want clear visual indicators when product attributes are in read-only mode, so that I understand why I cannot edit them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product attributes are in Read_Only_Mode, THE Order_System SHALL display a lock icon with explanatory text
2. THE Order_System SHALL show "Read-only (Verified & Approved)" indicator when attributes cannot be edited
3. WHEN product attributes can be edited despite being verified, THE Order_System SHALL display a warning message explaining the editable state
4. THE Order_System SHALL use distinct visual styling for read-only versus editable product attributes
5. THE Order_System SHALL display contextual headers indicating whether attributes are being created or edited

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to edit existing product attributes when they are not yet verified or the order is not approved, so that I can make necessary corrections before production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product attributes exist AND are not verified, THE Order_System SHALL allow editing of all attribute fields
2. WHEN product attributes exist AND the order is not approved, THE Order_System SHALL allow editing of all attribute fields
3. THE Order_System SHALL populate the edit form with existing attribute values when editing is allowed
4. WHEN editing existing attributes, THE Order_System SHALL display "Edit Product Attributes" as the form header
5. THE Order_System SHALL save changes to existing attributes when the user submits the form

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the read-only restrictions to apply to specific order statuses, so that the workflow maintains proper approval gates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Order_System SHALL consider orders with status APPROVED, ORDER_PROCESSING, READY_TO_SHIP, SHIPPED, or COMPLETED as approved for read-only purposes
2. THE Order_System SHALL allow editing when order status is PENDING regardless of verification status
3. WHEN an order transitions from PENDING to APPROVED, THE Order_System SHALL immediately apply read-only restrictions to verified attributes
4. THE Order_System SHALL maintain read-only restrictions throughout all post-approval order statuses
5. THE Order_System SHALL evaluate read-only status dynamically based on current order and verification states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want to override read-only restrictions for verified attributes on approved orders, so that I can make critical corrections when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Super_Admin accesses verified attributes on an approved order, THE Order_System SHALL allow editing despite normal read-only restrictions
2. WHEN a Super_Admin edits verified attributes, THE Order_System SHALL display a prominent warning about the override action
3. IF a Packing_Slip has been printed for an order item, THEN THE Order_System SHALL display a critical warning when Super_Admin attempts to edit attributes
4. THE Order_System SHALL clearly indicate when Super_Admin privileges are being used to override normal restrictions
5. WHEN Super_Admin saves changes to verified attributes, THE Order_System SHALL log the override action for audit purposes
