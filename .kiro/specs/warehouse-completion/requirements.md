# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the Warehouse Administrator system, focusing on finalizing the warehouse tracking workflow, fixing barcode generation, implementing email notifications, and completing the reporting system. The system currently has ~85% of functionality implemented and needs these final components to be production-ready.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: High-Quality Barcode Generation

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want to scan clear, readable barcodes from packing slips so that I can efficiently process items through production stations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a packing slip is generated THEN the barcode SHALL be high-resolution and scannable by standard barcode readers
2. WHEN a barcode is printed THEN it SHALL use proper Code 128 encoding with correct check digits
3. WHEN a barcode is displayed THEN it SHALL be crisp and clear at 4"x6" label size
4. WHEN a barcode scanner reads the barcode THEN it SHALL decode correctly to PREFIX-ORDER_NUMBER-ITEM_ID format

### Requirement 2: Complete 6-Step Warehouse Workflow

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager, I want items to progress through all 6 production stations with proper status tracking so that I can monitor production progress accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is scanned at Office station THEN item status SHALL change from NOT_STARTED_PRODUCTION to CUTTING
2. WHEN an item is scanned at Cutting station THEN item status SHALL change from CUTTING to SEWING
3. WHEN an item is scanned at Sewing station THEN item status SHALL change from SEWING to FOAM_CUTTING
4. WHEN an item is scanned at Foam Cutting station THEN item status SHALL change from FOAM_CUTTING to PACKAGING
5. WHEN an item is scanned at Packaging station THEN item status SHALL change from PACKAGING to PRODUCT_FINISHED
6. WHEN an item is scanned at Office station (final) THEN item status SHALL change from PRODUCT_FINISHED to READY
7. WHEN all items in an order are READY THEN order status SHALL automatically change to READY_TO_SHIP

### Requirement 3: Accurate Time and Activity Tracking

**User Story:** As a production manager, I want to track exactly how long each worker spends on each item at each station so that I can calculate labor costs and productivity metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker scans an item at their station THEN an ItemProcessingLog entry SHALL be created with startTime
2. WHEN a worker completes work on an item THEN the ItemProcessingLog entry SHALL be updated with endTime and calculated durationInSeconds
3. WHEN an item moves to the next station THEN the previous station's log SHALL be automatically closed
4. WHEN production starts (first scan at Office) THEN the order production timer SHALL begin
5. WHEN an order reaches READY_TO_SHIP THEN the total production time SHALL be calculated and stored

### Requirement 4: Single Kiosk Multi-Scanner System

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want to use my assigned barcode scanner at the single kiosk terminal so that my work is properly attributed to me and my station.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a barcode is scanned THEN the system SHALL identify the worker and station from the scanner prefix
2. WHEN multiple workers scan simultaneously THEN each scan SHALL be processed independently without conflicts
3. WHEN a worker scans an item THEN the system SHALL validate they are authorized for that station
4. WHEN a scan occurs THEN the system SHALL prevent workers from starting new items while they have active work

### Requirement 5: Email Notification System

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to receive email updates about my order progress so that I know when my items are ready for pickup or shipping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order status changes to APPROVED THEN customer SHALL receive "Order Approved" email
2. WHEN an order status changes to ORDER_PROCESSING THEN customer SHALL receive "Production Started" email
3. WHEN an order status changes to READY_TO_SHIP THEN customer SHALL receive "Order Ready" email with pickup/shipping details
4. WHEN an order is shipped THEN customer SHALL receive tracking information email
5. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry automatically

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Reporting System

**User Story:** As a business manager, I want detailed reports on employee productivity and order lead times so that I can optimize operations and calculate accurate labor costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating productivity reports THEN system SHALL show time spent per employee per station per day/week/month
2. WHEN calculating labor costs THEN system SHALL multiply time worked by employee hourly rate
3. WHEN generating lead time reports THEN system SHALL show average time from APPROVED to READY_TO_SHIP
4. WHEN viewing reports THEN users SHALL be able to filter by date range, employee, station, and customer
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN data SHALL be exportable to CSV format

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and data validation so that the system remains reliable under production conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid barcodes are scanned THEN system SHALL display clear error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN system SHALL retry operations automatically
3. WHEN data conflicts arise THEN system SHALL prevent data corruption and log issues
4. WHEN users attempt unauthorized actions THEN system SHALL deny access gracefully
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN detailed logs SHALL be created for debugging
