# Warehouse Priority Items Display - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adding a priority order items display panel to the warehouse kiosk interface. The feature will show a scrollable list of high-priority and urgent order items on the right side of the kiosk while maintaining the existing scan functionality on the left side. The scan input must remain the primary focus and cannot be unfocused by this new feature.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Split Layout Design

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want the kiosk interface to be split into two sections so that I can see priority items while still having easy access to the scanning functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the kiosk loads THEN the interface SHALL be split with scanning on the left (60% width) and priority items on the right (40% width)
2. WHEN the layout is displayed THEN the scan input SHALL remain the primary focused element
3. WHEN the priority panel is visible THEN it SHALL not interfere with the scan input focus
4. WHEN the screen is smaller THEN the layout SHALL remain functional with appropriate responsive design
5. WHEN users interact with the priority panel THEN the scan input SHALL automatically refocus

### Requirement 2: Priority Items Data Filtering

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want to see only the most relevant items in the priority list so that I can focus on what needs immediate attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying priority items THEN the system SHALL only show items with status "PENDING" or "CUTTING"
2. WHEN filtering items THEN the system SHALL exclude items in other production stages (SEWING, FOAM_CUTTING, PACKAGING, READY)
3. WHEN determining priority THEN the system SHALL consider order urgency flags and creation dates
4. WHEN multiple items exist THEN the system SHALL sort by priority level (urgent first, then by order date)
5. WHEN no priority items exist THEN the panel SHALL display an appropriate "No urgent items" message

### Requirement 3: Scrollable Priority List

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want to scroll through the priority items list so that I can see all urgent items even when there are many.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the priority list has more items than can fit THEN the panel SHALL be scrollable
2. WHEN scrolling the priority list THEN the scan input SHALL remain focused and functional
3. WHEN using touch or mouse to scroll THEN the interaction SHALL not affect the scan input
4. WHEN the list is scrolled THEN visual indicators SHALL show there are more items above or below
5. WHEN scrolling reaches the end THEN appropriate visual feedback SHALL be provided

### Requirement 4: Priority Item Information Display

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want to see essential information about each priority item so that I can identify and prioritize my work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying each priority item THEN it SHALL show order number, item name, and current status
2. WHEN showing item details THEN it SHALL include customer name and order creation date
3. WHEN items are urgent THEN they SHALL be visually highlighted with distinct colors or icons
4. WHEN displaying status THEN it SHALL use the same status names as the main scanning interface
5. WHEN showing multiple items THEN each item SHALL be clearly separated and easy to distinguish

### Requirement 5: Real-time Updates

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want the priority list to update automatically so that I always see the current state of urgent items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN items are processed through scanning THEN the priority list SHALL update automatically
2. WHEN item statuses change THEN items SHALL be added or removed from the priority list accordingly
3. WHEN new urgent orders are created THEN they SHALL appear in the priority list without page refresh
4. WHEN the priority list updates THEN it SHALL not disrupt the scan input focus
5. WHEN updates occur THEN the scroll position SHALL be maintained when possible

### Requirement 6: Scan Input Focus Protection

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want the scan input to always remain focused so that I can continue scanning without interruption regardless of the priority panel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking anywhere in the priority panel THEN the scan input SHALL automatically refocus
2. WHEN scrolling the priority list THEN the scan input SHALL remain the active focused element
3. WHEN the priority panel loads THEN it SHALL not steal focus from the scan input
4. WHEN interacting with priority items THEN the scan functionality SHALL remain unaffected
5. WHEN the kiosk detects focus loss THEN it SHALL immediately return focus to the scan input

### Requirement 7: Visual Integration

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want the priority panel to integrate seamlessly with the existing kiosk design so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the priority panel is displayed THEN it SHALL use the same color scheme and styling as the existing kiosk
2. WHEN showing the split layout THEN both panels SHALL have consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
3. WHEN displaying priority items THEN they SHALL use appropriate icons and visual indicators
4. WHEN the panel is empty THEN it SHALL show a professional empty state message
5. WHEN items are highlighted as urgent THEN the visual treatment SHALL be clear but not overwhelming

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a warehouse worker, I want the priority panel to load quickly and not slow down the scanning functionality so that my workflow remains efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the priority panel loads THEN it SHALL not delay the scan input initialization
2. WHEN fetching priority items THEN the request SHALL be optimized to return only necessary data
3. WHEN the list updates THEN it SHALL use efficient rendering to avoid performance issues
4. WHEN many items exist THEN the panel SHALL implement virtual scrolling or pagination if needed
5. WHEN the kiosk is under load THEN the priority panel SHALL not impact scan processing performance
