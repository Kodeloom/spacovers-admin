# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Diagnose and fix QuickBooks webhook authentication





  - Add comprehensive logging to `getQboClientForWebhook()` function to identify token retrieval failures
  - Implement token validation before making API calls in webhook processing
  - Add error handling and retry mechanisms for token refresh failures
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Enhance webhook processing error handling and logging





  - Improve error logging in `server/api/qbo/webhook.post.ts` for debugging authentication issues
  - Add detailed request/response logging for QuickBooks API calls
  - Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls with exponential backoff
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Investigate and fix OrderItem relationship isolation issues





  - Analyze existing OrderItem queries to identify where cross-order contamination occurs
  - Review API endpoints and frontend components that display/update order items
  - Identify specific code paths causing shared item status updates between orders
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Implement proper OrderItem query scoping





  - Ensure all OrderItem database queries include `orderId` in WHERE clauses
  - Modify item status update operations to target specific `OrderItem.id` rather than shared `Item.id`
  - Add validation to prevent cross-order item status contamination
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Fix item synchronization logic for order isolation





  - Modify sync operations to maintain correct itemOrder associations per specific order
  - Ensure sync processes create separate itemOrder records for same item types across different orders
  - Fix "no items" display issue after sync without affecting other orders
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.6, 2.7_

- [x] 6. Add comprehensive testing for webhook integration





  - Create unit tests for token management and authentication scenarios
  - Implement integration tests for webhook processing with mocked QuickBooks payloads
  - Add tests for signature verification and entity processing (Customer, Invoice, Item, Estimate)
  - _Requirements: 1.6, 3.5_

- [x] 7. Add comprehensive testing for OrderItem isolation





  - Create tests verifying OrderItem queries are properly scoped to individual orders
  - Implement tests ensuring status updates affect only intended OrderItem records
  - Add tests for sync operations maintaining proper order-specific relationships
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.5_

- [x] 8. Add monitoring and audit trails





  - Implement logging for all OrderItem status changes with order context
  - Add audit trails for debugging relationship issues between orders and items
  - Create monitoring for webhook success rates and authentication failures
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 9. Deploy and validate fixes in staging environment





  - Test QuickBooks webhook integration with real webhook notifications
  - Validate OrderItem isolation by creating multiple orders with same item types
  - Verify that status changes in one order don't affect items in other orders
  - _Requirements: 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5_
