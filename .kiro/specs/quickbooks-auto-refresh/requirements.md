# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing QuickBooks Online integration by implementing automatic token refresh functionality. Currently, users must manually reconnect to QuickBooks every time their access token expires (approximately every hour), which creates a poor user experience and interrupts business operations. This enhancement will provide seamless, automatic token management that works transparently in the background.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business administrator, I want to connect to QuickBooks once and have the integration work automatically for months, so that I don't have to constantly reconnect and interrupt my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator connects to QuickBooks THEN the system SHALL store both access and refresh tokens securely
2. WHEN the access token approaches expiration (within 5-10 minutes) THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it using the refresh token
3. WHEN the automatic refresh is successful THEN the system SHALL update the stored tokens without user intervention
4. WHEN the refresh token expires (after 101 days) THEN the system SHALL mark the integration as inactive and require reconnection
5. IF the automatic refresh fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and mark the integration as inactive

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager, I want QuickBooks data synchronization to work reliably without manual intervention, so that my operations are not disrupted by authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call to QuickBooks is made THEN the system SHALL automatically ensure a valid access token is available
2. WHEN making QuickBooks API requests THEN the system SHALL use the centralized token manager
3. WHEN a token refresh occurs THEN existing API operations SHALL continue seamlessly
4. WHEN the integration is active THEN all QuickBooks operations SHALL work without user authentication prompts
5. IF no valid tokens are available THEN API calls SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the QuickBooks integration status and token health, so that I can proactively address any connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the settings page THEN the system SHALL display current connection status and token information
2. WHEN tokens are refreshed THEN the system SHALL log the refresh events with timestamps
3. WHEN viewing connection details THEN the system SHALL show token expiry times and last refresh date
4. WHEN the integration is healthy THEN the system SHALL display a clear indicator that tokens refresh automatically
5. IF there are connection issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the QuickBooks integration to use a single company-wide connection rather than per-user connections, so that the system is simpler to manage and more reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to QuickBooks THEN the system SHALL store tokens at the company level, not per user
2. WHEN any authenticated user makes QuickBooks requests THEN the system SHALL use the shared company connection
3. WHEN disconnecting QuickBooks THEN the system SHALL deactivate the integration for all users
4. WHEN multiple users access QuickBooks features THEN they SHALL all use the same underlying connection
5. IF the company connection is inactive THEN no users SHALL be able to access QuickBooks features

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a background scheduler that proactively refreshes tokens before they expire, so that the system maintains continuous connectivity without waiting for API calls to trigger refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a token refresh scheduler
2. WHEN the scheduler runs (every 30 minutes) THEN it SHALL check if tokens need refreshing
3. WHEN tokens are within 10 minutes of expiry THEN the scheduler SHALL proactively refresh them
4. WHEN the scheduler successfully refreshes tokens THEN it SHALL log the success event
5. IF the scheduler encounters errors THEN it SHALL log the errors and continue monitoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want all existing QuickBooks API endpoints to automatically use the new token management system, so that no manual updates are required for existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL automatically use the new token manager
2. WHEN the token manager provides a valid token THEN existing endpoints SHALL work without modification
3. WHEN migrating to the new system THEN existing QuickBooks functionality SHALL remain intact
4. WHEN the new system is deployed THEN users SHALL not notice any functional differences
5. IF the migration introduces issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
