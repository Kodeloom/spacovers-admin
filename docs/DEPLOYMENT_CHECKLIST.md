# Production Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures all production environment configurations are properly verified before deployment.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Verification

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] All required environment variables are set
- [ ] DATABASE_URL format is valid and points to external PostgreSQL
- [ ] BETTER_AUTH_SECRET is at least 32 characters
- [ ] BETTER_AUTH_URL matches production domain
- [ ] AWS SES credentials configured (if using email notifications)
- [ ] QuickBooks credentials configured (if using integration)

### Application Build
- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] Prisma client is generated (`npx prisma generate`)
- [ ] All dependencies are installed
- [ ] No build errors or warnings

### Database Setup
- [ ] External PostgreSQL database is provisioned
- [ ] Database migrations are applied (`npx prisma migrate deploy`)
- [ ] Database connection is tested and working
- [ ] Initial data is seeded (if required)

### Deployment Platform
- [ ] Coolify project is created and configured
- [ ] Repository is connected to deployment platform
- [ ] Environment variables are set in platform dashboard
- [ ] Domain name is configured
- [ ] SSL certificate is set up (automatic with most platforms)

## üß™ Verification Scripts

Run these scripts to verify deployment readiness:

```bash
# Test standalone deployment compatibility
npm run verify:standalone

# Validate production configuration
npm run verify:production

# Verify Coolify-specific setup
npm run verify:coolify

# Test application startup
npm run verify:startup
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Pre-Deployment Check
```bash
# Ensure everything is committed
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Production deployment ready"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Platform
- Trigger deployment in Coolify/Railway/Render
- Monitor build logs for any issues
- Wait for deployment to complete

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","database":"connected",...}
```

### 4. Functional Testing
- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] Database operations function correctly
- [ ] Email notifications work (if configured)
- [ ] QuickBooks integration works (if configured)
- [ ] Barcode scanning functionality works
- [ ] Reports generate correctly

## üîç Monitoring Setup

### Health Monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- [ ] Configure alerts for health endpoint failures
- [ ] Monitor application logs for errors

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring (if available)
- [ ] Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory)
- [ ] Set up alerts for high resource usage

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf .nuxt .output node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

**Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Test database connection
npx prisma db pull
# Verify DATABASE_URL format
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

**Health Check Failures:**
- Check application logs in platform dashboard
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Test database connectivity
- Check for Prisma client initialization issues

**SSL/Domain Issues:**
- Verify DNS records point to platform
- Check SSL certificate status
- Update BETTER_AUTH_URL to match domain
