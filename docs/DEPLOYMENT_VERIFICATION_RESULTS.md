- Added proper error categorization (authentication vs connection issues)
- Implemented fallback status reporting

### 3. Production Configuration Validation
**Issue**: No comprehensive production environment validation
**Resolution**:
- Created `validate-production-config.js` script
- Added environment variable validation
- Implemented database URL format checking
- Added authentication and service configuration validation

## üìã New Verification Scripts Created

### 1. `scripts/validate-production-config.js`
- Validates all required environment variables
- Tests database connection and URL format
- Verifies authentication configuration
- Checks AWS and QuickBooks setup
- Validates build artifacts

### 2. `scripts/verify-coolify-deployment.js`
- Verifies Coolify-specific compatibility
- Checks Dockerfile configuration
- Validates environment templates
- Ensures no docker-compose dependencies
- Provides deployment instructions

### 3. Enhanced Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "verify:production": "node scripts/validate-production-config.js",
  "verify:coolify": "node scripts/verify-coolify-deployment.js"
}
```

## üîç Production Deployment Instructions

### For Coolify Deployment:

1. **Create PostgreSQL Service**
   - Add PostgreSQL service in Coolify
   - Note connection details for DATABASE_URL

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@postgres:5432/dbname"
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-32-character-secret"
   BETTER_AUTH_URL="https://your-domain.com"
   NODE_ENV="production"
   PORT="3000"
   HOST="0.0.0.0"
   ```

3. **Deploy Application**
   - Connect Git repository to Coolify
   - Select Docker build pack
   - Coolify will use the Dockerfile automatically
   - Monitor build logs for any issues

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Test health endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/health`
   - Verify application functionality
   - Check database connectivity

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**Database Connection Failures:**
- Verify DATABASE_URL format and credentials
- Check PostgreSQL service status in Coolify
- Test connection using validation script

**Build Failures:**
- Check build logs in Coolify dashboard
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Ensure Prisma client generation succeeds

**Health Check Issues:**
- Review application logs
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Test database connectivity manually

## üìà Performance and Monitoring

### Resource Requirements Verified:
- **Minimum**: 0.5 vCPU, 512MB RAM
- **Recommended**: 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM
- **Storage**: 2GB for application and logs

### Monitoring Endpoints:
- **Health Check**: `/api/health`
- **Status Codes**: 200 (healthy), 503 (degraded/unhealthy)
- **Response Format**: JSON with status, timestamp, and diagnostics
