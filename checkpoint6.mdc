# Project Checkpoint 6: Webhook Integration & Legal Compliance

This document summarizes the project's progress based on the "Warehouse Administrator" Product Requirements Document (Version 1.0), updating the status from Checkpoint 5. This checkpoint marks the successful implementation of QuickBooks webhook integration, completion of legal compliance requirements, and significant progress on core warehouse functionality.

## Current Status & Strategic Achievements (as of Checkpoint 6)

The project has successfully implemented real-time QuickBooks integration through webhooks, completed legal compliance requirements for production use, and established a robust foundation for warehouse operations. The system now operates as a fully independent warehouse management application with optional QuickBooks integration capabilities.
