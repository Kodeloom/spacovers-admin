# Project Checkpoint 4: QuickBooks Integration & UI Standardization

This document summarizes the project's progress based on the "Warehouse Administrator" Product Requirements Document (Version 1.0), updating the status from Checkpoint 3. This checkpoint marks the completion of QuickBooks Online integration for sync functionality, standardization of all admin UI modules, and resolution of critical component and API issues across the application.

## Current Status & Deviations by Phase (as of Checkpoint 4)

### Phase 0: Setup & Foundation

*   **[DONE]** Setup Nuxt.js project, install Tailwind CSS, Nuxt UI, and other dependencies.
*   **[DONE]** Setup PostgreSQL database and Prisma ORM.
*   **[DONE]** Integrated Better-Auth for user authentication.
*   **[DONE]** Integrated ZenStack for access control and auto-generated CRUD API.
*   **[PARTIAL]** QuickBooks Online integration infrastructure implemented, but still missing production dev account/keys.
*   **[DONE]** Version control (Git) is active.

**Key Libraries/Additions:**
*   **TanStack Query (`@tanstack/vue-query`):** Core to client-side data fetching and caching.
*   **Headless UI (`@headlessui/vue`):** Used for accessible UI components like modals.
*   **Reusable Components:** `AppSidebar`, `AppModal`, `AppWarningModal`, and `AppTable`.

### Phase 1: Core Data Models & Auth

    *   Resolved Prisma P2002 unique constraint errors with comprehensive error handling.
    *   Fixed "invalid request path" errors by replacing `$` prefixed parameters with proper query structure.
    *   Fixed Vue component prop mismatches (rows vs items, isOpen vs show, pending vs is-loading).
    *   Resolved toast API inconsistencies across all modules.
    *   Fixed async data loading issues and type safety problems.

### Phase 7: Deployment & Go-Live

*   All items in this phase: **Not Started**.

## Summary of Key Accomplishments (Since Checkpoint 3):

1.  **Complete QuickBooks Integration Infrastructure:**

    *   Added proper relationship handling between estimates and orders.
    *   Established correct database field naming conventions (transactionDate, totalAmount, estimateNumber, etc.).

4.  **Robust Error Handling:**
    *   Added comprehensive P2002 error handling for unique constraints.
    *   Implemented proper async data loading with error states.
    *   Fixed type safety issues across all form implementations.

    *   Consistent query parameter structure (skip, take, orderBy without $ prefixes).
    *   Proper toast API usage throughout the application.

## Current Technical Debt & Known Issues:

1.  **QuickBooks Developer Account:** Still the primary blocker for production QBO integration.
2.  **Component Architecture:** Some TypeScript "excessive stack depth" warnings (Nuxt type inference issues, not functional problems).
3.  **Data Validation:** Basic HTML form validation in place, but could benefit from more robust client-side validation.
4.  **Performance Optimization:** No specific optimizations done yet for large datasets.

## Next Immediate Steps (Priority Order):

### **[CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE]** Phase 0 Completion:
1.  **Obtain QuickBooks Online Developer Account:** This remains the single biggest blocker for production use.
2.  **Configure Production QBO Keys:** Once account is available, set up production API credentials.
3.  **Test QBO Integration:** Comprehensive testing with real QBO sandbox data.

### **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Phase 1 Completion:
1.  **Station Management UI:** Create `pages/admin/stations` following established AppTable patterns.
2.  **Enhanced Order Management:** 
    *   Add order creation functionality.
    *   Implement order status workflow management.
    *   Add barcode generation for orders.
3.  **Data Validation Enhancement:** Implement more robust form validation across all modules.

### **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Phase 3 Preparation:
1.  **Warehouse Tracking Models:** Finalize ItemProcessingLog and related schemas.
2.  **Barcode System Design:** Plan barcode generation and scanning interfaces.
3.  **Station-Role Associations:** Implement the optional station-role linking system.

### **[FUTURE]** Phases 4-7:
1.  **Email Notifications:** Once order workflows are stable.
2.  **Reporting System:** After warehouse tracking is implemented.
3.  **Testing & Polish:** Comprehensive UAT with real users.
4.  **Production Deployment:** Final phase after all features are stable.

## Architecture Decisions & Patterns Established:

1.  **Component Standards:**
    *   AppTable for all data listing with server-side pagination
    *   AppModal/AppWarningModal for confirmations
    *   Standard HTML forms with Tailwind styling
    *   ZenStack hooks for all data operations

2.  **API Patterns:**
    *   REST API calls for QuickBooks integration
    *   ZenStack auto-generated endpoints for CRUD operations
    *   Consistent error handling and user feedback

3.  **Data Flow:**
    *   QuickBooks as source of truth for synced data
    *   Local database with additional fields not in QBO
    *   Audit logging for all significant operations

## Risk Assessment:

*   **LOW RISK:** Core admin functionality is stable and well-tested.
*   **MEDIUM RISK:** QuickBooks integration works in development but needs production testing.
*   **HIGH RISK:** Warehouse tracking phase depends heavily on user workflow requirements that may need refinement.

This checkpoint represents a major milestone with most of the foundational work complete and QBO integration functional. The project is well-positioned to move into the warehouse-specific features once the QBO production account is established.
