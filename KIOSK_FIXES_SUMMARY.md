# Kiosk Issues Fixed

## 🚨 **Issues Identified and Fixed**

### **1. Processing Logs Not Being Created**
**Root Cause:** The `process-item.post.ts` API was using the enhanced Prisma client which enforces ZenStack policies. The user didn't have explicit `ItemProcessingLog` create permissions.

**Fix Applied:** 
- Switched to `unenhancedPrisma` for all processing log operations
- This matches the pattern used in `start-work.post.ts` and other warehouse APIs
- Processing logs should now be created successfully

### **2. Confusing Success Message for Status Checks**
**Root Cause:** When office scanners scanned items they couldn't process, it showed a green success message saying "This item is currently 'Item being processed at Cutting'" which was confusing.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `success: true` to `success: false` for status check messages
- Changed title from "Item Status" to "Status Check"
- This will now show as a warning/info message instead of success (green)

### **3. Message Timeout Too Short**
**Root Cause:** Messages disappeared after 5 seconds, not giving users enough time to read them.

**Fix Applied:**
- Increased timeout from 5 seconds to 8 seconds for both:
  - Status check messages (when office scanner can't process)
  - Success messages (when transitions complete)

### **4. Added Debug Logging**
**Added comprehensive logging to help troubleshoot:**
- Frontend: Logs API call parameters and responses
- Backend: Logs scanner validation, station info, processing log creation, and order status updates

## 🧪 **Expected Behavior After Fixes**

### **Successful Office Scanner Transition (NOT_STARTED → CUTTING):**
1. ✅ Item status changes from "Not Started Production" to "Cutting"
2. ✅ Processing log is created in the database
3. ✅ Order status changes from "APPROVED" to "ORDER_PROCESSING"
4. ✅ Success message shows for 8 seconds with workflow step info
5. ✅ Activity appears in recent activity log

### **Office Scanner Status Check (item already in CUTTING):**
1. ℹ️ Shows warning/info message (not green success)
2. ℹ️ Message: "This item is currently 'Item being processed at Cutting'. Office scanners can only start production (from 'Not Started') or finalize items (from 'Item Done')."
3. ℹ️ Message stays visible for 8 seconds
4. ℹ️ Adds status check to recent activity

## 🔍 **Debug Information Available**

Check server logs for:
- `🔍 Process Item Debug Info:` - Shows all API parameters
- `🔍 Scanner Info:` - Shows scanner validation details
- `🔍 Station Info:` - Shows station lookup results
- `📝 Creating processing log for ongoing work` - Confirms log creation
- `✅ Processing log created:` - Shows created log ID
- `🔄 Updating order status from APPROVED to ORDER_PROCESSING` - Order status change
- `✅ Order status updated to ORDER_PROCESSING` - Confirms order update

Check browser console for:
- `🚀 Calling process-item API with:` - Frontend API call details
- `✅ Process-item API response:` - API response details

## 🚀 **Ready for Testing**

All fixes have been applied. The processing logs should now be created properly, and the user experience should be much clearer with appropriate message types and longer display times.
