/**
 * Manual Test for Orders Page Metrics Integration
 * 
 * This file contains manual test scenarios to verify that the orders page
 * correctly integrates with the new metrics API and implements automatic refresh.
 * 
 * Requirements tested: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3
 */

/**
 * Test Scenario 1: Verify metrics API integration
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to /admin/orders
 * 2. Observe the metrics cards at the top of the page
 * 3. Verify that metrics are loaded from /api/metrics/orders
 * 4. Check browser network tab to confirm API calls
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Metrics cards show loading spinners initially
 * - API call to /api/metrics/orders is made with appropriate filters
 * - Metrics display real data from the database
 * - No hardcoded values are shown
 */

/**
 * Test Scenario 2: Verify filter integration with metrics
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to /admin/orders
 * 2. Change the time filter dropdown (e.g., from "Last 30 Days" to "Last 60 Days")
 * 3. Apply a status filter (e.g., select "Pending")
 * 4. Apply a customer filter
 * 5. Observe metrics updates
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Metrics refresh automatically when filters change
 * - API calls include the correct filter parameters
 * - Metrics reflect the filtered data
 * - Loading states are shown during refresh
 */

/**
 * Test Scenario 3: Verify automatic refresh on order updates
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to /admin/orders
 * 2. Note the current "Orders Pending" count
 * 3. Click "Verify Order" on a pending order
 * 4. Confirm the verification
 * 5. Observe metrics updates
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - "Orders Pending" count decreases by 1
 * - "Orders In Progress" count increases by 1
 * - Metrics refresh automatically without page reload
 * - No manual refresh needed
 */

/**
 * Test Scenario 4: Verify error handling
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to /admin/orders
 * 2. Temporarily disable network or cause API to fail
 * 3. Refresh the page or change filters
 * 4. Observe error handling
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Error message is displayed above metrics cards
 * - "Retry" button is available
 * - Existing metrics are preserved on error
 * - No application crash occurs
 */

/**
 * Test Scenario 5: Verify new metrics display
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to /admin/orders
 * 2. Observe all metrics cards
 * 3. Verify data accuracy against database
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Total Orders count matches database
 * - Total Value shows correct currency formatting
 * - Average Order Value is calculated correctly
 * - Items in Production shows sum of cutting, sewing, foam cutting, packaging
 * - Items Not Started shows correct count
 * - All metrics update based on applied filters
 */

/**
 * Test Scenario 6: Verify sync integration
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to /admin/orders
 * 2. Note current metrics
 * 3. Click "Sync All" or "Sync New"
 * 4. Wait for sync completion
 * 5. Observe metrics updates
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Metrics refresh automatically after sync
 * - New orders are reflected in metrics
 * - Total counts and values update correctly
 */

/**
 * Performance Test: Large dataset handling
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to /admin/orders with a large number of orders (100+)
 * 2. Change filters rapidly
 * 3. Observe response times
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Metrics load within 2 seconds
 * - Filter changes are debounced (500ms delay)
 * - No performance degradation with large datasets
 * - Loading states provide good user feedback

/**
 * Debugging Tips:
 * 
 * 1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
 * 2. Monitor network tab for API calls and responses
 * 3. Verify that /api/metrics/orders returns expected data structure
 * 4. Check that filters are properly passed as query parameters
 * 5. Ensure MetricsService is calculating values correctly
